    "1. **Mean hours worked varies by neighborhood** - some census tracts average well above 40 hours/week\n",
    "2. **Borough patterns** - Manhattan tends to have higher mean hours (finance, consulting, tech)\n",
    "3. **Gender gap exists everywhere** - men work more hours on average in every borough\n",

    "\n",
    "- Do high-hours neighborhoods correlate with high-income neighborhoods?\n",
    "- Where is the gender gap largest? (Look for dark green on the gender gap map)\n",
